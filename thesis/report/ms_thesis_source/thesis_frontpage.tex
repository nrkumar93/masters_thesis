% This is a template for  Masters' Theses at WPI.
% It complies (more or less) to the standards given by the Library 
% (as of February 1999)
%
% Feel free to use this file, but I give no guarantee for its compliance
% to standards (meaning I won't pay for the paper if the library rejects it :))
%
%
% The lengths (textheight, width etc.) are fine-tuned for ps1, ps2, and ps3, 
% but seem to be somewhat dependent on the machine you are using to compile, 
% the date, time, moon phase, the weather, and other quantum effects.
% You may have to change \oddsidemargin a little, but it's about 98% correct.
%
% Also, the spacing is correct (doublespacing with footnotes correctly
% singlespaced). Curiously, the font size is not specified in the
% regulations. So feel free to change it, but the majority of theses
% that I have seen is written in 12 point font.
% 
% As for the inclusion of graphics, I recommend the methods specified
% in ``latexguide.ps'' off the CS-GSO Website. You can use other
% methods including copy and paste with a photocopier, but I think
% using the graphicx package is the easiest.
%
% Have fun and good luck with the thesis.

%% This is the command for doublespacing when you use the setspace
%% package
%% Please do NOT use \baselinestretch, this will mess up everything,
%% cause earthquakes, tornados and lots of questions for me...
%% If you need a singlespaced paragraph (BAD STYLE!!!), use
%% \singlespacing or \onehalfspacing and enclose it together with the
%% paragraph in braces {\singlespacing This is my text... blah blah blah}
%%
%\doublespacing
%
%% Now you can start to be creative.
%% First, you need an abstract.
%% Fortunately, LaTeX has thought of that, so it's very easy:
%%
%\begin{abstract}
%This paper is the most important paper I have ever written. Therefore,
%everyone should read it, like it, and recommend it to all his friends.
%\end{abstract}
%
%% From here on, we need Roman page numbers according to the library
%% regulations. So let's assign those.
%
%\pagenumbering{roman} % or {Roman} if you like them capitalized
%
%% The next thing is the Preface (``Acknowledgements'').
%% No standard environment for that, so we'll format it by hand.
%%
%\begin{center}
%	\textbf{Acknowledgements}
%\end{center}
%
%	I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor who made
%	sure the thesis has at least 120 pages, 200 pictures and lots
%	of formulae and thus made me master \LaTeX{} like my native
%	language.
%
%        My thanks are also due to my reader... who has read the thesis
%        in the two days that I gave him since it wasn't done until two
%        days before due date.
%
%	Thanks also to ... lots of friends, the fact that a week has
%	seven days instead of only five as I had always thought, and
%	the fact that I own a key to the building so I can work at four
%	in the morning whenever I feel like it. That is, all the time.
%
%% P.S. You don't have to add me to the acknowledgements for providing 
%% this file :)
%
%\clearpage
%
%
%% Now comes the Table of Contents, really easy in LaTeX. you never
%% have to worried about it. (Think of all the hours you would
%% have wasted in Word getting this thing updated without crashing
%% the system) :).
%
%\tableofcontents
%
%% THAT'S IT. REALLY. Everything else is automatic. No formatting, no headline.
%% All predefined.
%
%% Now - just as easy - the List of Figures.
%% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{figure}\end{figure}
%% statements.
%\listoffigures
%
%% There is also a list of tables, if you have any.
%% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{table}\end{table}
%% statements.
%\listoftables
%
%
%% And we need a clear separation between preface and text, otherwise
%% the numbering gets confused.
%
%\clearpage
%
%% And now - tataa - the text.
%% This is the place to become really creative.
%
%% From here on, we need arabic numbering again and we need to start
%% from 1.
%
%\pagenumbering{arabic}
%\setcounter{page}{1}
%
%% 
%% Since this is a ``report'', the topmost level of hierarchy is
%% ``Chapter'', not section as you may be used to. Chapters are
%% enumerated starting from 1, so Sections are 1.1, Subsections are
%% 1.1.1, subsubsections don't get numbers. (You can change that, if
%% you want them to be called 1.1.1.1)
%%
%\chapter{First Chapter.}
%This should ideally contain some text.
%\section{First Section.}
%More Text.
%\subsection[Alternative title for the Table of Contents]{First Subsection.}
%Even more text, maybe a formula:
%\begin{equation}
%\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} % much easier than Microsoft Equation
%                                 % Editor :)
%\end{equation}
%\subsubsection{First Sub-subsection.}
%This is really deep down in the hierarchy. Maybe you shouldn't even
%use sub\-subsections. It goes further down (paragraphs), but I don't
%think you'll need that\footnote{By the way: notice that, although we
%have doublespacing here, the footnotes are singlespaced. This is
%intended and good. If you want to change that, try, but this is really
%how it should be.}.
%
%\section{Other thoughts.}
%Okay, what else?
%Let me quickly put a figure here, maybe a piece of pseudo code.
%That way, you can see how this is done. It's a little painful, but
%looks really cool. We will call it Figure~\ref{fig:source_algo1}. The
%numbering is automatic---don't worry about it.
%
%%First, we want to make our life easier and define a ``TAB'' command.
%\newcommand{\T}{\hspace*{5mm}}
%
%% Start a figure
%\begin{figure}[htb]
%% We would like to have the whole thing in the center of the page
%\begin{center}
%% We want a frame. 
%   \fbox{
%% The figure should autoformat to half the page width
%       \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
%% Now comes the content.
%% For source code, you have to leave an empty line after each line of
%% code.
%% Note that this is text-mode, that's why all formluae are typeset in
%% math-mode (enclosed in dollar-signs $a+b$)
%% Each line needs a font command a la \texttt{}, \textsc{}, textbf{}
%% You could use \begin{verbatim}\end{verbatim} for source code, but then 
%% you can't do any more formatting in you source file. May be appropriate
%% sometimes. 
%
%\textsc{Bellman-Ford} $(G,w,s)$
%
%(1) \textsc{Initialize-Single-Source}$(G,s)$
%
%(2) \textbf{for} $i\leftarrow 1$ \textbf{to} $|V[G]|-1$ \textbf{do}
%
%(3) \T\textbf{for} each edge $(u,v)\in E[G]$
%
%\T\T\T\textbf{do} \textsc{Relax} $(u,v,w)$
%
%(4) \textbf{for} each edge $(u,v) \in E[G]$
%
%\T\T \textbf{do if} $d[v]>d[u]+w(u,v)$
%
%\T\T\T \textbf{then return} \textsc{false}
%
%(5) \textbf{return} \textsc{true}
%
%% End of content, closure of minipage, frame, and centering.
%       \end{minipage}
%   }
%\end{center}
%% Caption
%\caption{This is a very simple algorithm in pseudocode.}
%% A label to refer to the figure.
%\label{fig:source_algo1}
%% End of figure
%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent
%And so on, and so on.
%
%Please remember that you have to compile a document several times when
%you did changes that affect figures, table of contents, bibliography,
%etc. (This is always the case if you get the warning: ``LaTeX Warning:
%Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.'').
%
%The recommended sequence is :
%
%\texttt{latex foo.tex}
%
%\texttt{bibtex foo}
%
%\texttt{latex foo.tex}
%
%\texttt{latex foo.tex}
%
%% Let's assume this is the end of your thesis text.
%
%% Now come appendices, if you had any.
%% Appendices are automatically numbered, just like everything else in
%% LaTeX. But only after you gave this command
%\appendix
%
%\chapter{More to say}
%
%\section{A section within an appendix.}
%This is an appendix.
%
%
%% Last and least (at least, that's what the library says) - the
%% Bibliography.
%
%
%% you can save some space by having the bibliography singlespaced, if you want
%\singlespacing
%
%%
%% You should become familiar with the BibTeX program, which
%% uses a *.bib-file to collect all citations that you have. It's a lot
%% prettier than typing all the citations right into the document. The 
%% reference to citations also works well that way, but the exact 
%% explanation of that will be on the CS-GSO homepage, whenever I'll ever 
%% have time for that.
%%
%%
%% If you use BibTeX, the bibliography is very easy. You refer to
%% citations in the text with \cite{tag}, where tag is the tag that you
%% defined in the bib-file.
%% Then, you run bibtex once in a while during compilation, and the
%% rest is done in two lines:
%
%
%\bibliographystyle{alpha}
%\bibliography{foo}

% which assumes a file foo.bib in your working directory.
% The word ``Bibliography'' will appear in your document as soon as
% you used ``bibtex'' on the command line.
%
% For reference on this, refer to the CS-GSO homepage.

%That's all, folks. Have fun.
